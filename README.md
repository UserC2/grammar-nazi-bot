### macOS Users:
- `grep` is incompatible with the `-P` flag, so you will need to install GNU grep.
- Install GNU grep: `brew install grep`
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is required to run this command.
- You will also have to modify `stop`, see `stop` for instructions.

### Non-macOS Users:
- `dbstart` and `dbstop` will not work, you will need to install mongodb and then modify those files to properly start mongodb.
